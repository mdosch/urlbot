To use the playbook, create a yaml file credentials.yml
with the following content (you can use vault to encrypt):

jid: yourjabber@id.to.use
password: yourpasswordforthisjabber
rooms:
   - debianforum.de@chat.debianforum.de # your channel
   - spielwiese@chat.debianforum.de # bot playground
bot_nickname: T800 # your bots nickname
bot_owner: MASTER # your nickname (for info and admin stuff)


Further, you need a hosts-file with the following content:

[bots]
yourserverip
# or alternatively,
derpy_name ansible_host=yourserverip


There is deploy.sh which I created so I have a single file to
deploy my stuff - it uses a virtualenv (py2!) with ansible and
 some vault file declaration.
